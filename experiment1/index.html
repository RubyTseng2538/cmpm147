				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In the process of integrating and innovating upon the fantasy perfume description generator, I first modified the code to store used filler, ensuring a more coherent output. However, scents still repeated, prompting the addition of another dictionary to store used scents. Now, if a scent matches a previously stored one, the generator rerolls until three distinct scents are generated for each output. These technical improvements enhance the generator's performance, providing users with more varied and engaging fantasy perfume descriptions.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>My main struggle revolved around finding the balance between maintaining the integrity of the generator code and addressing the inconsistency it presented. Opting to modify the code, I encountered several challenges along the way. However, adapting the code to tackle this limitation proved to be a pivotal success, significantly enhancing the coherence of our output.Throughout the process, I stumbled upon unexpected challenges like repeating scents, but implementing a new mechanism to reroll scents solved this challenge and improved the generator's performance. In the end, I created a generator I am satisfied with.</p>
