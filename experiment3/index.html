				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment, I attempted to create a convincing snow map while incorporating variation.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>To enhance the generated appearance of the map while maintaining its visual appeal, I introduced more randomness to the location where trees are generated. However, the lake generation remained mostly consistent in the code. To introduce variation to both tree generation and the lake, I randomly added ground code after the trees and lake were generated.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I encountered some challenges in achieving variation in the map's appearance. Attempting to make the lake generation more varied led to issues with auto-tiling, particularly in locations where the provided tiles could not replicate the desired appearance. As a result, I had to impose more restrictions on the lake. However, auto-tiling for trees around the original trees was more straightforward, and it enhanced the forest's density.</p>
